robot = get_robot(args.robot)(xmlfile)
params = robot.params()

use normed parameters

env is just normal environment (which we can replace with our own environment)
The robot parames are passed in through the xml file (which we can change to make it hardcoded)

Everytime, observation is concatenated with the robot parameters in the augmented environment

Could be the initialization or the assignment problem

right now I set the range to 0.1, 0.1, 0.3
While the sampling is around these values
(0.05 - 0.2) (0.05 - 0.2) (0.15 - 0.6)


It is not using the GPU... So it might be using CPU / stuck at somewhere
