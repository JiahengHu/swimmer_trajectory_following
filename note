robot = get_robot(args.robot)(xmlfile)
params = robot.params()

use normed parameters

env is just normal environment (which we can replace with our own environment)
The robot parames are passed in through the xml file (which we can change to make it hardcoded)

Everytime, observation is concatenated with the robot parameters in the augmented environment

Could be the initialization or the assignment problem

right now I set the range to 0.1, 0.1, 0.3
While the sampling is around these values
(0.05 - 0.2) (0.05 - 0.2) (0.15 - 0.6)


It is not using the GPU... So it might be using CPU / stuck at somewhere

1. It is on-policy, meaning that a replay buffer is not being used
2. rollout_length = 1024??? Meaning it will collect 1024 amount of data and then use it to do update?

Okay so the save freq determines everything

mpi_adam_robot?
Also, need a way to save the robot parameters

episode length: need to change in both env and init

change the save freq
change the number of episode

maxtimesteps? What does it do?

Why initialized 8 times? Which of the parameters shall we use?


Why 40 only 1 iteration? need to figure out the relationshipt between these different things
