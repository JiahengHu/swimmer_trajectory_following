robot = get_robot(args.robot)(xmlfile)
params = robot.params()

use normed parameters

env is just normal environment (which we can replace with our own environment)
The robot parames are passed in through the xml file (which we can change to make it hardcoded)

Everytime, observation is concatenated with the robot parameters in the augmented environment
